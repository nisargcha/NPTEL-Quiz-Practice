## 🧾 Overview  

Opening each week’s NPTEL quiz manually was **time-consuming and repetitive**, so I built this tool for **personal and peer use**.  
It combines **all weekly MCQ, MSQ, and NAT questions** into one clean webpage, making practice and revision super easy.  

All questions are stored in a `.json` file and dynamically loaded through **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.
